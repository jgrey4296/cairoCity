   Generate a heightmap
   draw lines that follow a direction and respect the heightmap
   draw lines that split from a line: both perpendicular, and as a tree branch
   intersect two lines
   Subdivide a face consistently through drawing lines
   lines with open nodes perpendicular, streets take up perpendicular nodes,
   -- and walk the perimeter to get the boundaries of building sites
   
   get a convex hull of nodes, collapse lines to a central point,
   add circular lines around a point.
